# AGENTS.md

Agent instructions for research automation.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `rs <topic>` | New research |
| `frk` | Fork existing research |
| `st` | List sessions with PDF paths |
| `pdf <topic>` | Generate PDF |
| `tst` | Run tests in Docker |

If message starts with these commands — it's a research operation, not development.

---

## rs

New research. Dialog first, then launch.

ask language Which language for the result?
  - English
  - Russian
  - Spanish
  - Greek

After language selected — switch all follow-up questions to that language.

ask provider Which data provider?
  - parallel (cheaper and faster)
  - valyu (more thorough, premium result)
  - all (run parallel then valyu)

ask processor What compute level? (
  - parallel:
    - pro
    - ultra
    - ultra8x
  - valyu: 
    - fast
    - standard
    - heavy

ask topic — minimum 3 questions, up to 5 (in selected language):
  - Scope: narrow vs broad? specific case or general overview?
  - Audience: who reads this? expert level or beginner-friendly?
  - Focus: which aspects matter most? what angle interests you?
  - Constraints: exclude anything? time period? geography? industry?
  - Output: actionable insights? comparison? trends? recommendations?

rule Always ask at least 3 topic questions before launching
rule User can say "enough" to skip remaining questions
do Surface blind spots and non-obvious angles through questions

If user asks for two runs at once:
- ask the same questions twice, explicitly for run A then run B (no multi-select)
- collect params for run A and run B (topic, language, provider, processor)
- start two docker containers (different names) and report both

brief format:
- short title (max 120 chars, no colons/subtitles) + "Research:" + flat numbered list
- title = noun phrase, not a question or full sentence
- bad: "Is AI image generation real creativity or just entertainment?"
- good: "AI art as creativity"
- dense single-line items, all details via dash/colon in one line
- no bold, no subheadings, no nested lists, no extra sections
- language = result language

run docker build -t research .
query="Язык ответа: {language}.\n\n{brief}"
run docker run -d --name "research-{timestamp}-{slug}" \
    -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
    -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
    -e PARALLEL_API_KEY -e VALYU_API_KEY -e GEMINI_API_KEY -e REPORT_FOR \
    research run "{topic}" "{query}" --processor "{processor}" --language "{language}" --provider "{provider}"

If two runs requested, run the command twice with different {timestamp}-{slug} values.

notify container_name
notify estimated_time
notify pdf_path — exact full path (no wildcards!), build after getting session ID

Example output:
```
Container: research-20241221-1430-clojure-pdf
Processor: ultra8x
Provider: parallel
Time: 5-50 min
PDF: /Users/chichikov/Work/research/output/2025-12-21_clojure-pdf_3e4fc072/2025-12-21_clojure-pdf-parallel.pdf [NOT READY]
```

## frk

Fork existing research. Dialog first, then launch.

ask source Which research to fork?
  - If user already specifies, resolve by meaning (folder name, topic, or hint)
  - Otherwise show last 3-5 from output/ (by mtime) as numbered list
  - Accept selection by number, folder name, or description ("the one about quantum computing")

ask type What should we do?
  1. re-brief - adjust the inputs
  2. deep-dive - go deeper into part of the result

re-brief flow:
  - Load brief from selected session:
    - prefer output/<session>/brief-*.md
    - fallback: output/<session>/input-*.md or data/briefs/<session-id>.md
  - Ask user for changes, keep brief format from rs
  - Show diff preview (original brief vs updated brief) before launch, ask confirmation
  - Run new research with updated brief (provider/processor default to original unless user overrides)
  - Save as new session in output/

deep-dive flow:
  - Load output/<session>/response-*.json into context
  - Summarize sections/fragments and ask which to deepen (3-5 options)
  - Ask clarifying questions about desired focus
  - Generate new brief from chosen fragment
  - Show diff preview (original brief vs new brief) before launch, ask confirmation
  - Run new research with updated brief (provider/processor default to original unless user overrides)
  - Save as new session in output/

If multiple providers exist in a session, ask which one to fork.

---

## st

List sessions. For each:
- Topic
- Status (in_progress % / completed)
- Full PDF path
- If file missing — mark [NOT READY]

Example:
```
[HITL startups] in_progress (67%)
  PDF: /Users/chichikov/Work/research/output/2025-12-21_hitl-startups_3e4fc072/2025-12-21_hitl-startups-parallel.pdf [NOT READY]

[AI coding assistants] completed
  PDF: /Users/chichikov/Work/research/output/2025-12-20_ai-coding_8f2a1b3c/2025-12-20_ai-coding-parallel.pdf
```

---

## pdf

Generate PDF by topic. Find session by meaning (not by ID).

run docker run --rm \
    -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
    -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
    -e REPORT_FOR \
    research generate {id}

notify pdf_path (full path)

---

## tst

Run tests in Docker container.

run docker build -t research-test -f Dockerfile.test .
run docker run --rm research-test :unit
run docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/tmp_cache:/app/tmp_cache" research-test :integration

notify test results (pass/fail count)

---

## Parallel processors

| Name | Time | Use case |
|------|------|----------|
| `pro` | 2-10 min | Default, exploratory |
| `ultra` | 5-25 min | Multi-source deep |
| `ultra2x` | 5-50 min | Complex deep research |
| `ultra4x` | 5-90 min | Very complex |
| `ultra8x` | 5 min-2 h | Maximum depth |

Tip: add `-fast` for speed (pro-fast, ultra-fast)

## Valyu models

| Name | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `fast` | Quickest, lighter research |
| `standard` | Balanced depth and speed |
| `heavy` | Deeper, more thorough |

---

## Environment

```bash
export PARALLEL_API_KEY="..."
export VALYU_API_KEY="..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
export REPORT_FOR="..."
```
